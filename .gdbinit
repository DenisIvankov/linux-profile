# Disable Python pretty printers (they are generally broken)
disable pretty-print

# Enable GDB's internal pretty printing (generally just adds whitespace formatting)
set print pretty on

# Pagination pauses printing when screen is full and asks user if they want to stop or continue. I always want it to print the full output (and I sometimes regret it but I'm okay with that)
set pagination off
